this file is used to confirm that /pipelines/pre-merge.yaml and /pipelins/post-merge.yaml are working as expected:

1) pre-merge.yaml should run when a PR is opened against the master branch
2) post-merge.yaml should run after a PR is successfully merged onto the master branch:
    - Pipeline should not run during the PR process
    - pipeline should run only once per successful PR 


delete this file when both are working as expected
